Android AppMsg (Crouton) Library
==============================

Implementation of in-layout notifications. Based on [Toast](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/Toast.html) notifications and article [The making of Prixing #4: in-layout notifications](http://android.cyrilmottier.com/?p=773) by [Cyril Mottier](http://www.cyrilmottier.com/).


Description
-----------

Toast is far from being perfect and I am not entirely satisfied with it. 
Toast can be un-accurate in some cases. Indeed, Toast has one major drawback: it completely breaks contexts. 
This issue can be reproduced effortless. Let’s say a user is currently in an app firing a Toast and wants to switch to another application using the dedicated “multitask” button. 
The Toast will remain on screen even if the brought-to-front application has nothing do to with the previously shown app as described on the following figure:
![Example Image][1]

As you can easily notice, the problem with Toasts is they are persistent. 
Once a Toast has been fired, it is displayed on top of any screen and remains visible for the duration specified at its creation.

In order to bypass the Toast persistence problem and ensure information is displayed in the correct context, we decided to create a new notification system: 
Activity-bound notifications. This is what it looks like in the current version of Prixing:

Crouton overcomes the main issue of having a Toast being shown while the menu is open. 
It sticks to the current screen sliding with it and leaving the menu completely free of any information that would have not been related to it.
